What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of 52 cards, if you reshuffle your first draw back into the deck before making your second draw? What would that probability be if you didnâ€™t reshuffle after your first draw?

A:

In the first case when the first draw is made, if it's reshuffled before making the next draw then the probability would be the product of drawing one each time, or $$ (4 / 52) * (4 / 52) = 1 / 169 = .6\%  $$.

In the second case, the probability of drawing it on the first try is $$ 4 / 52 = 1 / 13 $$
while the probability of drawing it the second time is $$ 3 / 52 $$ since the previously drawn ace is not put back, so the final value is $$ (1 / 13) * (3 / 52) = .44\% $$

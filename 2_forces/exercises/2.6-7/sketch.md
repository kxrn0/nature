How does tossing around work? I would like to do more than just setting the center of the circle to the mouse's coordinates when moving it.

When I intent to move the mouse, I press it down, a variable is changed that tracks this. The mouse is first at (a, b), one moment later it's at (c, d). I would like to pull the circle in this direction. Maybe draw a line between the mouse and the center of the circle to make it look like I'm pulling the circle with a rope. I have two coordinates, I can find the difference between them, and apply this as a force to the mover.
